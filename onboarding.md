# Onboarding developers :computer::gift_heart:

Welcome to your ultimate onboarding guide (with no other options really) that will help kick start you into Insurello!

## Dev teams values

To be able to work and bring good value to our customers and to understand and work better together we believe it's
important that we share some core values.

* Moving in the right direction is more important than to be moving fast
* You are a big part of us! We value you as a person and also your initiatives and thoughts

Do you agree with these? Want to talk about them? Let us.

### We want to get to know eachother
We want to create a team where we can have fun while moving the product forward.
To be productive and explore awesome solutions to our problems the team needs trust. Trust in that
your teammates are there to help you, trust in that everyone is doing the best they can under current circumstances,
trust in that "failing" does not mean singleing out someone to blame but that failing sometimes is a must for getting
closer to great solutions and is a part of our work.

There are a lot of ways to gain trust but a good start is to get to know eachother.
Don't be afraid to talk to people! People might seem very busy but getting to know you and for you to know us is important.
Trust can take some time to build up but the more we do together the faster it grows.

### Pairing up to help get you "warm in your clothes"

In order for you to get into the team and product we will do a lot of pair programming. This is a great tool for sharing knowledge and to get to know eachother at the same time. Pair programming can be quite intense which we are aware of so it will not be enforced to do all the time but highly encouraged.

We use **Strong-style Pair Programming**: “In order for an idea to go from your head into the computer, it must go through someone else’s hands”. In other words you need to explain any solution so well so the other one gets it. Stealing the keyboard and rushing out the code for the solution you came up with often leads confusion and leavrd the other person behind in thought and makes it harder to catch up - which might ruin the whole session.

Try to use a timer and rotate driver and navigator often, for example every 10 minutes.
