# Onboarding developers :computer::gift_heart:

Welcome to your ultimate onboarding guide (with no other options really) that will help kick start you into Insurello!

## Dev teams values

To be able to work and bring good value to our customers and to understand and work better together we believe it's
important that we share some core values.

* Moving in the right direction is more important than to be moving fast
* You are a big part of us! We value you as a person and also your initiatives and thoughts

Do you agree with these? Want to talk about them? Let us.

### We want to get to know eachother
We want to create a team where we can have fun while moving the product forward.
To be productive and explore awesome good solutions the team needs trust. Trust in that
your teammates are there to help you, trust in that everyone is doing the best they can under current circumstances,
trust in that "failing" does not mean singleing out someone to blame but that failing sometimes is a must for getting
closer to great solutions and is a part of our work.

There are a lot of ways to gain trust but a good start is to get to know eachother.
Don't be afraid to talk to people! People might seem very busy but getting to know you and for you to know us is important.
Trust can take some time to build up but the more we do together the faster it grows.
