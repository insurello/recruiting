# Elm code test
This is a small code test in Elm-lang. You will be given an existing application and some new requirements.
Your mission is to fulfill these requirement by changing the code in the existing application. 
The main focus of the test is the discussion and code review afterwards. 
What did you learn? What was your thought process? Possible problems? and so on.


## Rate it!
In this little webapp you can rate ...it! "But what is 'it'?" you might say. That doesn't matter.

### New requirements
* Instead of the rating being showed as a number, it should be shown as 1 to 5 filled stars.
* Initally, before any rating as been provided 5 unfilled stars should be shown.
* We also need a new "Clear" button that resets the rating to 5 unfilled stars again.

Good luck!
