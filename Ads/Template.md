# Software Engineer — { Role }
### Stockholm, Sweden — Engineering

## About us
Insurello is a startup that helps injured people receive compensation. Where today – every year – 6 billion SEK never gets claimed because of the hustle associated with the insurance claim process. We have been awarded one of the Nordic regions top-50 start-ups, and won Start-up of the Year in November 2017 (Business Challenge). In 2018 we raised more than 10 million SEK from leading venture capitalist firms. Now we need some great additions to the team to help us disrupt the insurance industry.

## What you will do
We work as an agile and highly collaborative product team that includes both design and engineering. You and the team will have a clear mission and ownership of the product and the customer experience. At Insurello we optimize for quality, flow and customer value. We have a long term view of what we build, but deliver new features and improvements continuously for fast feedback and time to market. Each week the product team organizes a two hour workshop dedicated to planning and design review. The team continuously reviews all code that becomes a part of the product and we value clarity, reliability and focus when we review. We aim to always move in the right direction and to always make the best decision with the facts at hand. We want to build a team that is inclusive and open and feels a strong ownership and dedication for the things they build.
