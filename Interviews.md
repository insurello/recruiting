# Interview process (developers)

## Overview

After each step in the process the people interviewing or being involved in that step writes down thoughts for 4 min before discussing with anybody else, at least one good thing and one bad thing — without being affected by others influence, and then have a short meeting where the thoughts are shared.
The process can be terminated after any step if the interviewers find the candidate unfit for some reason.
Whenever we make a decision to move forward or to terminate we inform the candidate within 1 workday about the next
step or tell her/him about the termination, and we give some feedback of what we liked about the candidate and what we think was missing.

The interview process is also about us giving a good impression to the candidate. We might lose great candidates if we don't seem to care much about them, if we are late or don't greet them properly for example.

In any interview situation there should not be more than 2 of us interviewing at the same time. It can be very intimidating to sit in front of a "full panel" of people judging you and it might cause the candidate to not show who she/he really is.
It is still a good idea for the candidate to meet several people within the team and company so have different people be in charge of different steps of the process. 

In each meeting, think about the environment for the interview: avoid "panel positioning" (2 or more of us on one side and candidate alone on one side), a coffee table or lunch place could create an environment more suitable for creating a casual discussion and getting to know the person on the first meeting. Unless you are doing some kind of presentation test or stress test the more casual environment the better.

Depending on the candidate we can have different tracks:
### Scenario 1
Candidate with promising skills within our tech stack
```
Meet and greet 
|
Communication and planning
|
We yay or nay
```
### Scenario 2
Candidate lacks skills within our tech stack but is promising in other ways
```
Meet and greet
|
Code test (sent home)
|
Talk about solutions in code next meeting
|
Communication and planning 
|
We yay or nay
```
## Details
### Meet and greet
1. Meet the candidate *PROPERLY*. Show them respect by being on time and greet them by the door etc.
 — We want to give the candidate a good first impression
2. We tell the candidate about our interviewing process, which steps there are and that we give feedback within 1 workday after each step.
3. We start by telling the candidate about ourselves personally, and what Insurello does and **what our values are**
4. The candidate tells us about herself/himself
5. Super casual talking, and we try to get a "feel" on the candidate. Goals? Experiences? Hobbies?
   — A question to the candidate about how she/he solves a tech/solution disagreement with team members could be interesting.
6. We tell the candidate that we will get in touch again later the same day or the next work-day.
7. We get in touch with the candidate and either terminate the process and provide some feedback or we continue and book the next meeting or send code test.
8. It's also important to say good bye properly. It can get awkward or confusing if someone just leaves mid meeting without saying good bye.
  — Remember to thank the candidate for their time (or say thanks in some other nice way).
  — We want to give the candidate a good "last" impression

### Communication and planning
If we are quite sure of the candidate's technical skill level within our tech stack it we will try actively to test the candidate's communication skills and how well the candidate is at structuring her/his work and problem solving.

By communication skills we mean communicating things like **ideas**, **strategies**, **solutions**, **problems**, **good things**, **code**, **empathy**. It kind of boils down to how well the person fits in the team.

By problem solving we want to see how the candidate breaks the problem down and structure it and what solutions come to mind and how the candidate plans to go forward even if the candidate doesn't yet know the full/ the best solution.

#### Possible ways to test
* We ask the candidate to spend about 15 min reviewing some piece of our code and talk about what the candidate has to say about it.
* One or two of our developers pair/mob program (real or pseudo code) a solution for a tricky problem (such problems can be found at [exercism.io](https://exercism.io))
 — Not all people are comfortable with pair programming, especially with people they don't know and trust well yet and especially in an interview process. Ask about that before doing this test.
   — Focus a lot more about the team work rather than how "smart" the solution is. If you had fun with the candidate and did a good job getting closer to a solution that's probably a good sign.
   — Pick a problem that you don't know a good solution to straight away. If you pick something you know chances are you will either just give away the solution or not participate in the teamwork of solving it at all.
* Ask the candidate about a tricky problem that is not code related, for example: "Your job is to find out how many ping-pong balls fits in this room. How would you go about solving that? Try to speak what you're thinking, use whiteboard if you want to"
 — Can the candidate find ways to break the problem down into smaller pieces?
   — Can the candidate explain in an understandable way her/his plan to solve the problem and the actual solution?

### Code test (sent home)

To candidates that cannot in other ways show how good they are to adapt/learn/use our tech stack we send them a code test after the first meeting.
 
#### Things we can find in the candidate's code
* Ability and willingness to learn new things
* Code structuring
* Code readability
* If the candidate can write code at all

##### Notes
— If the code is in some way terrible we might terminate after we've seen the code but in general we move forward to the more important step of having a review of the code and solution with the candidate.
— Don't make the test too big.

#### Review
Perhaps the most important thing is to review the code and solution with the candidate in the next meeting. Look out for terrible solutions but in general it's more about the discussion and how the candidate motivates her/his solution and steps taken. It's interesting to hear about the candidates own reflections about possible improvements that can be done or problems with the current solution. Try create an interesting discussion about this. Try to see how the candidate reacts and talks about possible improvements that you suggest as well. Did the candidate find it interesting/fun to learn?
— Keep in mind that the languages/tech stack might be completely new to the candidate, and she/he probably doesn't know about all the common conventions within it yet, so don't focus too much on the nitty gritty.

#### Question
What would you say we are looking for in a code test? Is it a valuable test?

### We yay or nay
In the final step everyone who has been a part of the interview process share their thoughts about the candidate and decides if we should give her/him an offer or not. If one of us says No, it's a No.

#### Our values
Throughout the process we should talk a bit about our values as a company and our goals for the tech side of things. 
For example, we do code reviews and value creating solid solutions and well-structured code that move us in the right direction. We believe a lot of developers wants to work like that and some come from a background where doing that was not appreciated enough. Highlighting this during some step could therefore make our workplace more interesting for the candidate.
